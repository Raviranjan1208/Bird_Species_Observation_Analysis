🐦 Bird Observation Analysis using Python & Plotly
📌 Overview
This project analyzes bird observation data to uncover patterns in species diversity, distribution, and environmental influences. Using Python (Pandas, Plotly), we explored multiple aspects such as wind speed effects, visit patterns, habitat preferences, disturbance impacts, and conservation priorities.

The project features interactive visualizations for deeper insights.

📊 Key Analyses & Insights
1️⃣ Wind Speed Effect
Most bird sightings occur at low wind speeds.

Higher wind speeds lead to fewer observations — possibly due to reduced bird activity or detection challenges.

2️⃣ Visit Patterns
First visits record the highest species diversity.

Later visits detect fewer new species, suggesting diminishing returns.

3️⃣ Habitat & Sex Distribution
Males more frequently observed in grasslands, females in forests.

A large share of records have undetermined sex, limiting gender-specific analysis.

4️⃣ Watchlist & Stewardship Status
Certain PIF Watchlist categories align with high regional stewardship priorities, highlighting urgent conservation targets.

5️⃣ AOU Code Patterns
Few AOU codes dominate observation counts, suggesting abundant or easily detectable species.

Some codes show high diversity but low counts, indicating rare but diverse groups.

6️⃣ Disturbance Impact
Low-disturbance habitats support higher species diversity.

High disturbance leads to fewer observations.

7️⃣ Activity Patterns
Singing is the most common detection method, especially in shorter intervals.

Longer intervals capture more varied behaviors.
